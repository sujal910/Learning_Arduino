# Breadboard Explained

A **breadboard** is a reusable tool for building and testing electronic circuits without soldering. It allows you to connect components just by inserting their legs into small holes.

## Structure of a Breadboard

### Middle Section

The center area is used for components.
Holes in each row are connected **horizontally**, usually in groups of five.
This lets you connect resistors, LEDs, sensors, and wires easily.

### Power Rails

The long lines on the sides are called power rails.
They are connected **vertically** and are mainly used for:

* Positive voltage
* Ground

## Why Breadboards Are Important

* No soldering needed
* Components can be reused
* Circuits can be changed quickly
* Best for learning Arduino and electronics

## Simple Example

If you place an LED leg and a resistor leg in the same row, they become electrically connected. This helps you build circuits just like on paper but in real life.

A breadboard is a safe and easy way to experiment before making a permanent circuit.
